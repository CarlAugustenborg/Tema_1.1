Cyan-44b is for the people who enjoy connecting with the wild. Millions of species wander this jungle covered planet. A lot has already been discovered but there are believed to be many more so there is a great chance you can find new ones. The planet is protected from hunters and you will be punished if you decide to do it, so remember to bring lots of food. 
There will be an opportunity to get a tour guide to show you around the different landmarks and locations. There are lots of places to camp out but there are also hotels if you don’t want to sleep under the stars. Unlike Tau-ceti the air is not human friendly because there is to much oxygen. Therefore, it’s very important you remember your oxygenchip.
